Ibanera Wallet can be opened at Ibanera.com, the Ibanera app or by contacting us here. All crypto received will initially be transferred to an account at one of Ibanera’s or its affiliates’ institutional custodians.
In order to open your account, we will first verify your identity and require you to provide acceptable forms of identification. To help the governments fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, laws and regulations requires us to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account. We may also ask for your driver’s license or other identifying documents. For business accounts, we may require identification information related to a controlling manager and/or equity owners of your business. You represent and warrant that all information provided to us pursuant to these Wallet Terms or otherwise is true, accurate and not misleading in any respect. If any such information changes, it is your obligation to update such information as soon as possible. Note that we may use credit reports or other information from third parties to help us determine if we should open or maintain your account.
Ibanera Wallet is not available in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, or any other country to which the United States embargoes goods or imposes similar sanctions. Ibanera Wallet is not available in the State of New York, or any other jurisdiction which we determine we would not be able to offer or chose not to offer a Ibanera Wallet. Due to the dynamic nature of regulatory requirements and interpretations in the cryptocurrency market, we reserve the right to update the list of prohibited jurisdictions and reject applications to open accounts that we determine we would be unable to accept for regulatory or policy reasons in our sole and absolute discretion.
Your account is not deemed to be opened, and we have no responsibility to you unless and until you have received written (which may be electronic) confirmation from us that your account has been opened. We are not obligated to accept an application from any applicant, and we reserve the right not to open an account for any applicant in our sole and absolute discretion.

          Your Ibanera Wallet is not a checking or savings account, and it is not covered by insurance against losses. We will pledge, repledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer or use funds and cryptocurrency assets to counterparties, and such cryptocurrency assets will be exposed to various risks as a result of such transactions in certain jurisdictions, cryptocurrency is not legal tender, and is not backed by the government. Accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency. <Spacer />
Transactions in cryptocurrency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. If you attempt to transfer assets to an unsupported wallet or using an unsupported network, or if you attempt to transfer assets other than eligible cryptocurrency (including any unsupported digital assets) to your Ibanera Wallet, such assets may be permanently lost. We assume no liability, obligation or responsibility whatsoever with respect to any unsupported digital asset or any asset that is transferred using an unsupported network or to an unsupported wallet. Some cryptocurrency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer initiates the transaction. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange government-issued currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear.<Spacer />
There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of cryptocurrency relative to government-issued currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time. The nature of cryptocurrency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack, including rollback attacks or blockchain reorganizations. The nature of cryptocurrency means that any technological difficulties experienced by Ibanera may prevent the access or use of a customer’s cryptocurrency. Any bond or trust account maintained by Ibanera for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers. Considering these risks, you should carefully consider whether holding cryptocurrency in a Ibanera account is suitable.

          We are not liable to you for errors that do not result in financial loss to you. We may take any action authorized or permitted by these Wallet Terms without being liable to you, even if such action causes you to incur fees, expenses or damages. <Spacer />If third parties make claims on your account, or if we receive conflicting instructions from authorized signers, or if we become involved in or concerned about a dispute between you and an authorized signer, we have discretion to act in ways we believe to be appropriate, including by closing your Ibanera Wallet and returning the cryptocurrency in such account. You are liable for all expenses and fees we incur for such conflicts or disputes, including internal costs and attorneys’ fees, and we may charge them to your Ibanera Wallet.<Spacer />
          Fraudulent activity, including any attempt to withdraw assets that you do not own, did not transfer into your Ibanera Wallet, or did not purchase, is strictly prohibited and may result in the closure of your Ibanera Wallet. Fraudulent activity includes any attempt to take advantage of errors on the Ibanera Website, systems, applications, or technology platforms. Any errors identified should be flagged to Support@Ibanera.com for appropriate compensation, where applicable.

          If legal action such as an attachment, garnishment, seizure, liquidation, levy or other state or federal legal process (“legal process”) is brought against your Ibanera Wallet, we may refuse to permit (or may limit) withdrawals or transfers from your account until the legal process is satisfied or dismissed. We may also be required to transfer the assets in your Ibanera Wallet at the behest of governmental authorities pursuant to legal and regulatory actions. Regardless of the terms of such attachment, garnishment, levy or other state or federal process, we have first claim to all assets in your account.
We will not contest on your behalf any such legal process and may take action to comply with such legal process as we determine to be appropriate in the circumstances without liability to you. If we incur any expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney fees, in connection with any such legal process, we may charge any expenses and fees to your account or any other account you may have with us without prior notice to you, or we may bill you directly for such expenses and fees. Any garnishment, seizure, liquidation, or other levy against your account is subject to our right of setoff.

          You grant us a security interest in any and all of your Ibanera account(s) with us for obligations owing to us or any of our affiliates by any owner of any of your accounts. These obligations include both secured and unsecured debts and debts you owe individually or together with someone else, including debts and obligations under other transactions or agreements between you and us or any of our affiliates.<Spacer />
We may take or set off assets in your Ibanera Wallet, or transfer assets between any or all of your Ibanera Wallet, with us or any of our affiliates for direct, indirect and acquired obligations that you owe us or our affiliates, including any balances as a result of not having sufficient assets available or as a result of an erroneous transfer of assets to an address under your control, or a return or other negative balance, regardless of the source of assets in an account.<Spacer />
These rights are in addition to other rights we have to take, transfer or charge assets in your account for obligations you owe us or our affiliates. We may consider these Wallet Terms as your consent to Ibanera’s asserting its security interest or exercising its right of setoff should any laws governing your account require your consent.<Spacer />
If the law restricts our ability to take, transfer or setoff against assets in your account, or if some contributions are protected from attachment, levy or legal process to the extent that you may do so by contract, you waive those conditions and limits and authorize us to apply assets in any or all of your accounts with us to obligations you owe us. Exercising these rights may result in early withdrawal penalties.<Spacer />
We hereby agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you may take or set off assets in your account, or any amounts we owe you with respect thereto, against the Obligations. If the law restricts your ability to take, transfer or setoff assets in your account, or if some contributions are protected from attachment, levy or legal process to the extent that we may do so by contract, we waive those conditions and limits and authorize you to apply assets in any or all of your accounts with us to the Obligations.

In addition, your account will be closed automatically if we do not receive your initial transfer of assets to your Ibanera Wallet within sixty (60) days of the date on which your account is opened. If your account has a balance when we close it, and you provide a valid wallet address to us, we will return the remaining crypto assets to that address, unless prohibited by applicable law. We will cooperate with any regulatory or governmental entity’s instructions or requests regarding your Ibanera Wallet, including freezing it and seizing its assets if mandated.

          Our platform allows you to review your Ibanera Wallet and conduct certain other transactions online. You must maintain adequate security and control of all IDs, passwords, hints, or any other codes that you use to access your Ibanera Wallet through our online platform. Any loss or compromise of the foregoing information or your personal information may result in unauthorized access to your Ibanera Wallet. We assume no responsibility for any loss that you may sustain due to compromise of your sensitive information. You accept all risks of unauthorized access and use of your Ibanera Wallet.<Spacer />
Tell us promptly if you believe that an electronic transfer has been made without your permission. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the assets in your Ibanera Wallet (plus any other Ibanera account you own). If your statement shows transfers that you did not make, tell us immediately by contacting us here.<Spacer />
Please contact our support, as soon as you can, if you think your statement is wrong or if you need more information about an item listed on the statement. We must hear from you no later than thirty (30) days after we send you or make available to you the first statement on which the problem or error appeared.<Spacer />
If you tell us orally or via electronic means, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing, and we may request additional information within ten (10) business days. We will endeavor to determine whether an error occurred within ten (10) business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to forty-five (45) days to investigate your complaint or question. For errors involving new accounts, we may take up to ninety (90) days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within ten (10) business days for the amount of the error, so that you will have the use of the assets during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. For new accounts, we may take up to twenty (20) business days to credit your account for the amount you think is in error.
If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing, or request additional information, and do not receive it within ten (10) business days, we may not credit your account. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
