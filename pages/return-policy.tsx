          Ibanera is a financial institution that provides OTC and buys and sells
digital assets, including Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and custodial
services. Ibanera provides a web3 service that helps users discover and
directly interact with NFTs available on public blockchains. We provide
custody and settlement of the NFTs but has no control of the blockchains
you are interacting with and we do execute and effectuate purchases,
transfers, or sales of NFTs. To use our Service, you must use a third-party
wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.

          <Text color="#393F59" fontSize={{ base: "14px", md: "16px" }} mb={3} >
          Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to
provide additional terms for specific services (and such services are
deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be subject to these
Terms). Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with
the relevant service, then become part of your agreement with us if you
use those services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any
additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific service, such
additional terms shall control for that specific service.

          Ibanera reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time
and in our sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we
will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes, such as by
providing notice through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date
at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service,
you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms
incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are
updated. It is your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time
to view such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and
conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.

           Like much of web3, your blockchain address functions as your identity on
Ibanera. Accordingly, you may use an external blockchain address and a
third-party wallet to access the Service. Your account on the service
(“Account”) will be associated with your blockchain address; however, if
you want to add some flair to your Ibanera persona, you can add
additional information, such as a profile picture, to your Account.
          </Text>
          <Text color="#393F59" fontSize={{ base: "14px", md: "16px" }} mb={3} >
          Your Account on Ibanera will be associated with your linked blockchain
address and display the NFTs for that blockchain address (and, if
applicable, any content associated with such NFTs). By using your wallet in
connection with the Service, you agree that you are using that wallet under
the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets
are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Ibanera, and Ibanera
does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has
no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Ibanera accepts no
responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet
and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Service will
operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping
your wallet secure and you should never share your wallet credentials or
seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet,
please contact your wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for
your Account and any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts
or omissions by you in connection with your Account or as a result of your
Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us
if you discover or otherwise suspect any security issues related to the
Service or your Account (you can contact us here).

          You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable
laws (e.g., local, state, federal and other laws) when using the Service.
Without limiting the foregoing, by using the Service, you represent and
warrant that: (a) you are not located in, ordinarily resident in, or organized
under the laws of any jurisdiction that is subject to a comprehensive U.S.
Government embargo (`Embargoed Jurisdiction`); (b) you are not subject
to any sanctions administered by an agency of the U.S. Government, any
other government, or the United Nations (collectively, “Sanctions”); (c) you
are not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by any person that is
subject to Sanctions, or that is located in, ordinarily resident in, or
organized under the laws of, any Embargoed Jurisdiction; (d) none of your
officers, managers, directors, shareholders or authorized representatives is
subject to Sanctions, or is located in, ordinarily resident in, or organized
under the laws of, any Embargoed Jurisdiction, or is owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by any person that is subject to Sanctions or that is
located in, ordinarily resident in, or organized under the laws of, any
Embargoed Jurisdiction. You further covenant that the foregoing shall be
true during the entire period of this agreement. If you access or use the
Service outside the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring
that your access and use of the Service in such country, territory or
jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws.

          Ibanera may require you to provide additional information and documents
in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government
authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, or to investigate a
potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, Ibanera, in its sole
discretion, may disable your Account and block your ability to access the
Service until such additional information and documents are processed by
Ibanera. If you do not provide complete and accurate information in
response to such a request, Ibanera may refuse to restore your access to
the Service.

          Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to time
for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of
equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Service or
other actions that Ibanera, in its sole discretion, may elect to take. If your
Account becomes inactive for six months or longer, as determined by
Ibanera in its sole discretion, you understand that Ibanera may disable
your Account or reassign your username or associated url.

old but under 18 years old, you may only use Ibanera through a parent or
guardian’s Account and with their approval and oversight. That account
holder is responsible for your actions using the Account. It is prohibited to
use our Service if you are under 13 years old.

      <ListItem mb={2}>Dispute Resolution. Please read the following arbitration agreement
in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to
arbitrate disputes with Ibanera and limits the manner in which you
can seek relief from us. This section does not govern disputes
between users or between users and third parties. Ibanera does not
provide dispute resolution services for such disagreements and the
parties must resolve those disputes directly.
</ListItem>

<ListItem mb={2}>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute,
controversy, or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the
Service, to any products sold or distributed through the Service, or to
any aspect of your relationship with Ibanera, will be resolved by
binding arbitration, rather than in court, including threshold
questions of the arbitrability of such dispute, controversy, or claim
except that (1) you or Ibanera may assert claims in small claims
court, but only if the claims qualify, the claims remain only in such
court, and the claims remain on an individual, non-representative,
and non-class basis; and (2) you or Ibanera may seek injunctive or
equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction if the claim relates to
intellectual property infringement or other misuse of intellectual
property rights.

</ListItem>
<ListItem mb={2}>Dispute resolution process. You and Ibanera both agree to engage in
good-faith efforts to resolve disputes prior to either party initiating
an arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or equitable relief for
intellectual property infringement. You must initiate this dispute
resolution process by sending a letter describing the nature of your
claim and desired resolution to: Ibanera, Attn: Legal Department, 78
SW 7th St 7-118, Miami, FL 33130. Both parties agree to meet and confer
personally, by telephone, or by videoconference (hereinafter
“Conference”) to discuss the dispute and attempt in good faith to
reach a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of
arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. If you are represented by
counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but
you agree to fully participate in the Conference. Likewise, if Ibanera is
represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in the
Conference as well, but Ibanera agrees to have a company
representative fully participate in the Conference. The statute of
limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the
parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process and
Conference required by this paragraph. If the parties do not reach
agreement to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after
initiation of this dispute resolution process, either party may
commence arbitration, file an action in small claims court, or file a
claim for injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction
for matters relating to intellectual property infringement, if the
claims qualify.
</ListItem>
<ListItem mb={2}>Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To
begin an arbitration proceeding after participating in the dispute
resolution process, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and
describing your claim to our registered agent at Ibanera, Attn: Legal
Department, 78 SW 7th St 7-118, Miami, FL 33130. The arbitration will be
conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution
provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under
$250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be
subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration
Rules and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect; all
other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS
Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect. JAMS’s rules are
available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352- 5267. If
JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an
alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot
afford to pay JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees
and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Ibanera will pay them for you
if you complied with the dispute resolution process set forth above.
In addition, Ibanera will reimburse all such JAMS filing,
administrative, hearing, and/or other fees for claims totaling less
than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are
frivolous or you did not comply with the dispute resolution process
set forth above, except that if you have initiated the arbitration
claim, you will still be required to pay the lesser of $250 or the
maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration
claims initiated by you. You are still responsible for all additional
costs that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation,
fees for attorneys or expert witnesses. You may choose to have the
arbitration conducted by telephone or videoconference, based on
written submissions, in person in your hometown area (if you live in
the United States), or at another mutually agreed upon location that
is reasonably convenient to you. Any judgment on the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction.
</ListItem>
<ListItem mb={2}>Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to
(a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration
Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any
part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration
will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Ibanera. The
arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other
matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall
have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary
damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available
to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and
these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
statement of decision describing the essential findings and
conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation
of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to
award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law
would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
you and us.</ListItem>
<ListItem mb={2}>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND IBANERA HEREBY WAIVE ANY
CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE
A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Ibanera are instead
electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration
under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the second
bullet of this Section 16, above (“Applicability of Arbitration
Agreement”). An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as
a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and
court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</ListItem>
<ListItem mb={2}> Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations. ALL CLAIMS AND
DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE
ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PAGA) OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS.
ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE
USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED
WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY. Accordingly,
under the arbitration procedures outlined in this section, an
arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one party’s
claims without the written consent of all affected parties to an
arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, you and Ibanera agree that no dispute shall proceed by
way of class arbitration without the written consent of all affected
parties. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes
enforcement of any part of this subsection’s limitations as to a given
claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration
and brought in the state or federal courts located in New York
County in the State of New York. All other claims shall be arbitrated.</ListItem>
<ListItem> TSeverability. Except as provided in this Section, if any part or parts of
this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or
unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force
and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</ListItem>
<ListItem>Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the
termination of your relationship with Ibanera.
</ListItem>
<ListItem>Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the
contrary, we agree that if Ibanera makes any future material change
to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within
thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to
Ibanera at the following address: Ibanera, Attn: Legal Department, 78
SW 7th St 7-118, Miami, FL 33130.</ListItem>
